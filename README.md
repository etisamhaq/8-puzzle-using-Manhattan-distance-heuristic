# 8-puzzle-using-Manhattan-distance-heuristic

This Python program employs the Manhattan distance heuristic and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to efficiently solve the classic 8-puzzle problem, which involves rearranging eight numbered tiles within a 3x3 grid to reach the goal state. By estimating distances using the Manhattan heuristic, it provides a clear and optimal solution to the puzzle.

## Introduction

The 8-puzzle is a classic puzzle that involves arranging eight numbered tiles within a 3x3 grid to reach the goal state. This program uses the Manhattan distance heuristic to estimate the distance between the current state and the goal state, and BFS to find the optimal sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.

## Features

- Solves the 8-puzzle problem using the Manhattan distance heuristic and BFS.
- Provides an efficient way to find the optimal sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.
